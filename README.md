# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis-Project
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a heart disease dataset using three key data mining techniques: Random Forest for classification, K-Means for clustering, and the Apriori algorithm for frequent pattern mining. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease and uncover significant patterns and risk factors.
